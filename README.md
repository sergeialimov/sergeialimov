- 👋 Hi, I’m @sergeialimov
- 👀 I’m interested in Back-end programming
- 🌱 I’m working with Node.js, TypeScript, SQL, and NoSQL databases
- 🌱 I also have some Front-end background with React and Vue but prefer to focus on Back-end tasks
- 🌱 I have QA and QA Automation background. There's no need to explain to me how to test my code and why it should look and work well
- 🌱 I'm also fine with learning new technologies and programming languages. I started my programming way in 2015, and I didn't stop since then
- 🌱 I started with Java and think that it's very well-documented and has a great community
- 🌱 I'm ok with Linux but prefer macOS on the local machines
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some cool project with no legacy or with a clean and reachable plan for its reducing
- 💞️ I wiped out more than half of my GitHub stats while refactoring repositories. Shit happens, lessons learned
- 💞️ I hate the war. I help both ukranians and russians. I have Russian citizenship, partial Ukrainian roots, Turkish residence permission, and I prefer to speak English with my kids
